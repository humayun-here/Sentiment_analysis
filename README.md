# Sentiment_analysis
Sentiment analysis using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sentiment Reasoner) is a popular technique for analyzing the sentiment of text data, particularly in social media
VADER is a rule-based model that uses a pre-built lexicon of words and corresponding sentiment scores. It captures not only the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) but also the intensity of the sentiment. VADER is especially effective at analyzing short, informal texts and handles nuances like capitalization, punctuation, and emoticons, making it useful for tasks like product reviews or social media posts analysis.
